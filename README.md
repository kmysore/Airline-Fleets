I decided to use Python to clean and prepare the data for use in Tableau, in order give you a range of my skills. 

I have attached the Python notebook in my github account, but if for some reason you are unable to view it, you may use the alternate link above. Python allowed me to address issues such as null values, formatting issues, and cost calculations. 

After cleaning the data, I was able to create a dashboard in Tableau to visualize some of the various measures of the dataset. The goal of this dashboard was to provide spend analysis of major Airlines in terms of Historic, Current, and Future Costs. Additionally, I wanted to drilldown and detail the specific Aircrafts purchased leading to those costs. Finally, I wanted to look at some of the popular Aircrafts in operation currently as well as examine some of the newer and older Aircrafts being utilized by these Airlines. 

The dashboard is fully customizable and can be filtered by Parent Airline, Airline, and Aircraft type. This would allow the user to detail various measures of their Airline company and compare them directly to their competitors. Please see Tableau dashboard link above.
